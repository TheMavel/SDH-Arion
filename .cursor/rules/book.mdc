### Chapter-based, Consistent Story Development

# Chronological Chapter Structure:
- The books are written in chapters arranged in chronological order.
- Each chapter follows its predecessor in temporal sequence.

# Review and Analysis:
- Before beginning a new chapter, all previous chapters are read thoroughly.
- The scenes within are analyzed in terms of their emotional impact and significance.

# Stylistic Consistency:
- When writing new scenes, we adhere to the writing style of the existing chapters.
- This ensures that the entire narrative remains stylistically uniform and coherent.

# Storyboard Integration:
- Before writing, refer to the storyboard [storyboard.md](mdc:storyboard.md) to determine if ideas for further developing the story already exist idea is present, a new chapter progression is suggested and proposed.

# Additional Guidelines:
- Use the specified tagging format: [CHAR:Name], [PLACE:Location], [ITEM:Object], [SCENE-ID: X-Y].
- Refer to storyboard.md for plot points and character arcs.
