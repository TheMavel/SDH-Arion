A modern, minimalistic digital book reader application interface. The screen displays a chapter of a book written in clean, readable markdown-style formatting. The UI includes a sidebar on the left listing chapter titles (e.g., chapter1.md, chapter2.md, etc.). The main content area on the right shows formatted markdown with headings, paragraphs, and embedded images (referenced from a dedicated /images/ folder).

A small, elegant music player bar is fixed at the bottom or top right corner: it has a play/pause toggle, volume control slider, and shows 'Now Playing' from a /music/ folder. The layout is uncluttered, with soft shadows and high readability. Font is monospaced or minimal serif. The overall color palette is neutral (white, gray, soft blue), perfect for long-form reading.
