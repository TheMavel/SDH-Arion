Island training with shadow manipulation elements. Begin with tropical beach ambience (waves, birds) with simple island instrumentation (kalimba, small percussion). For Fiori's character, alternate between sharp, percussive sounds when she's harsh and flowing melodic lines when she's vulnerable. Shadow training sequences should incorporate unusual sound design elements - reversed sounds, whispered vocals, and strange percussive effects suggesting the manipulation of shadows. Their intimate conversation requires a stripped-back approach with simple piano and atmospheric sounds. For successful shadow manipulation moments, create swirling, echoing effects that give a sense of accomplishment. Overall atmosphere: Training challenge mixed with character development.
