Ancient library atmosphere with growing suspicion. Create a scholarly soundscape using minimal piano patterns, gentle harpsichord figures, and subtle bell sounds suggesting Brian's research. The Varitas library should feature occasional ambient drones and delicate chime sounds creating an ancient atmosphere. For moments of discovery, incorporate brief, bright bell sounds that stand out from the background. Brian's thoughts of Julie require a simple, emotional melody that temporarily interrupts the scholarly sounds. As suspicion grows, gradually introduce subtle dissonant elements and slightly unsettling electronic textures. Overall atmosphere: Academic curiosity gradually shifting to intellectual suspicion.
