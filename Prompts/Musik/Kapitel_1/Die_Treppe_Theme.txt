Natural canyon ambience transitioning to mysterious cave soundscape. Start with authentic Grand Canyon environmental sounds (wind, distant birds) with subtle acoustic guitar suggesting the hangover humor. As their journey begins, add dusty percussion on natural objects and Native American-inspired flute melodies. For the cave discovery, shift to eerie resonant sounds - water drops, hollow metallic tones, and crystal bowls creating the blue glow atmosphere. The staircase and portal should build tension through deep electronic bass pulses and swirling atmospheric effects. End with a dramatic sound design moment suggesting their fall. Overall atmosphere: Natural wonder to otherworldly mystery.
