Ancient scholarly atmosphere with mystical revelations. Create a meditative soundscape using minimal piano patterns and gentle bell tones suggesting Brian's analytical mind. The Varitas camp setting requires ancient instrument sounds (dulcimer, small chimes) with occasional ambient drones. When Pilus appears, introduce a mysterious melody using unusual scales. For the ancient book revelation, incorporate subtle glass sounds and ethereal textures. Brian's thoughts of Julie should be represented by a simple, emotional melody that briefly interrupts the scholarly sounds. End with subtle tension as Brian makes his agreement with Pilus. Overall atmosphere: Intellectual curiosity with underlying uncertainty.
