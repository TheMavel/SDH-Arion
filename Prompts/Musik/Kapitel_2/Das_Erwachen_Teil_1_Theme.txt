Primeval forest soundscape with tribal transformation elements. Begin with authentic forest ambience (birds, rustling leaves, distant water) with minimal musical accompaniment. As Andrew explores, add simple wooden flute melodies using pentatonic scales. For Hegowe's appearance, introduce powerful tribal drums and deep throat singing to represent the wolf-man. The transformation sequence requires intense percussion rhythms with animal-like sound effects. Conclude with driving drums suggesting their journey together. Overall atmosphere: Confusion to acceptance of a wild new reality.
