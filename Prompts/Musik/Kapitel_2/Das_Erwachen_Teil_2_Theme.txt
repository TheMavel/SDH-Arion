Tropical beach setting with sudden combat intensity. Begin with authentic ocean wave recordings, seagulls, and gentle island-inspired instruments (kalimba, ukulele, small percussion). For Fiori's appearance, add a mysterious female humming melody with subtle electronic effects during her eye-color changes. The Kappa attack requires an immediate shift to intense Japanese-inspired percussion (taiko drums, wood blocks) with aggressive rhythms. Use a moment of silence for Jake's shocking realization of killing, followed by uneasy ambient sounds reflecting his inner turmoil. Conclude with tentative music suggesting their uncertain alliance. Overall atmosphere: Peaceful beach to life-threatening danger.
