Secret archive intrigue with growing confrontation. Begin with quiet, tense ambient sounds suggesting Brian's stealthy exploration of restricted areas. Create a secretive atmosphere using:
- Soft string plucks and muted percussion
- Occasional resonant tones suggesting the ancient library
- Sparse, deliberate piano notes creating tension

For the forbidden knowledge discovery, incorporate ancient-sounding instruments played in unusual scales. Loyd's character should have deceptively pleasant melodies with subtle dissonance hidden underneath. As confrontation builds, increase rhythmic intensity with overlapping patterns creating mounting tension. The portal artifact should have strange, otherworldly sounds unlike anything else in the piece. End with unresolved musical tension that leaves listeners expecting more. Overall atmosphere: Academic espionage leading to dangerous revelation.
