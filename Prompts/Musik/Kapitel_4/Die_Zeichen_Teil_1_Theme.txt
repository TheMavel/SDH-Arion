Spiritual animal connection in a mystical forest. Begin with nighttime forest ambience (crickets, distant owls) with subtle ambient pads creating a moonlit atmosphere. As Anthos appears, introduce noble-sounding horn melodies with shimmering percussion suggesting his glowing antlers. The communion sequence should feature:
- Gentle wordless vocals creating an ethereal atmosphere
- Crystal bowl or singing bowl sounds that feel mystical
- Subtle nature-based percussion (stones, wood, water)

For Andrew's transformation, build intensity with tribal drumming and processed vocal effects suggesting the merging of human and animal spirits. Conclude with a triumphant yet mystical fusion of human and animal elements. Overall atmosphere: Sacred connection to nature and animal spirits.
