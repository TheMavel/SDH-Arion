Ambient music blending Mexican beach sounds with mystical elements. Begin with gentle acoustic guitar and subtle Latin percussion establishing the vacation setting. For the ayahuasca ceremony, transition to otherworldly sounds - wooden flutes, rain sticks, and ethereal vocal textures without words. The vision sequence should incorporate subtle electronic elements (reversed sounds, echoing tones) that create a dreamlike quality. End with a simple 5-note "destiny" motif that feels ancient yet memorable. Overall atmosphere: From carefree vacation to mystical revelation. Key: D minor, moving to more exotic scales during vision.
