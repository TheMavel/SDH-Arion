A digital painting of three hungover friends descending into a mysterious glowing cave, ancient petroglyphs illuminated on the stone walls around them, in the heart of the Grand Canyon with towering red rock formations framing the scene, cinematic Star Wars poster style, dramatic lighting with ethereal blue light emanating from within the cave contrasting with the harsh sunlight above, rich earth tones with mystical blue accents, vertically composed with the cave entrance dominating the lower half and the vast canyon stretching above, tense and mysterious atmosphere, a spiral symbol with wing-like elements faintly glowing on the cave wall, helicopter visible as a tiny silhouette against the sky at the very top, 9:16 aspect ratio.
