A digital painting of an injured Brian conversing with the enigmatic Pilus in a Varitas tent, magical text glowing in an ancient book between them, in a sprawling scholarly encampment with towering jewel-encrusted mountains visible through the tent opening, cinematic Star Wars poster style, dramatic lighting with warm amber lantern light inside contrasting with the cool mountain twilight outside, rich blues and golds with mystical silver accents on Pilus's robes, vertically composed with Brian's resting area in the lower portion and the mysterious mountain settlement rising above, scholarly yet mysterious atmosphere, ancient symbols subtly embroidered on the tent walls, Brian's wedding ring glinting with significance in the foreground, 9:16 aspect ratio.
