A digital painting of Jake standing with Bahla beside a portal to the Schattentiefe (Shadow Depths), tendrils of living darkness reaching out from the shadowy gateway, in Bahla's mystical home carved into the highest cliff of Relia, cinematic Star Wars poster style, dramatic lighting with Bahla's completely black eyes absorbing all light around her while Jake's face is illuminated from the portal's otherworldly glow, rich blues and blacks with sinister purple energy emanating from the shadow portal, vertically composed with Jake and Bahla in the lower portion and the towering shadow portal extending upward, ominous and mystical atmosphere, Fiori watching with concern from the background with her arms crossed, whispering shadows forming faces and patterns within the portal opening, 9:16 aspect ratio.
