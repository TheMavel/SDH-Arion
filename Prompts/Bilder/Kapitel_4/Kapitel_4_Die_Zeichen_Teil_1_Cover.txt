A digital painting of Andrew communing with his newly discovered spirit animal Anthos, a magnificent stag with glowing antlers, mystical energy forming a connection between them, in a sacred forest clearing bathed in moonlight, cinematic Star Wars poster style, dramatic lighting with ethereal moonbeams filtering through mist and illuminating the scene, deep forest greens and mystical blues with golden energy where Andrew and Anthos connect, vertically composed with Andrew kneeling in the lower portion and Anthos towering above him with the night sky visible beyond, spiritual and transformative atmosphere, ghostly silhouettes of other forest animals observing from the tree line, tribal Mor markings subtly appearing on Andrew's skin where the connection energy touches him, 9:16 aspect ratio.
