A digital painting of Brian confronting Loyd in a restricted section of the Varitas archives, ancient relics and forbidden texts surrounding them as tension builds, in a hidden mountain chamber with architectural elements suggesting an ancient temple purpose, cinematic Star Wars poster style, dramatic lighting with ominous shadows cast by flickering torches creating a sense of conspiracy and danger, deep burgundies and golds with eerie green light emanating from some of the forbidden artifacts, vertically composed with Brian and Loyd in confrontation at the bottom while the imposing architecture and mystical relics tower above them, suspenseful and threatening atmosphere, a partially visible portal relic on a pedestal between them with subtle connections to the symbols from the original gate, Pilus watching the confrontation unseen from a hidden vantage point, 9:16 aspect ratio.
