A digital painting of three young men sharing a cosmic vision during an ayahuasca ceremony, spiritual energy flowing between them connecting their minds, in a dimly lit shamanic hut with the Mexican beach visible through an open doorway, cinematic Star Wars poster style, dramatic lighting with mystical blue and purple hues illuminating their faces from below, rich earth tones with vibrant energetic accents, vertically composed with the three friends centered in the lower half and ethereal symbolic imagery hovering above them, mystical and foreboding atmosphere, ancient symbols and a white portal faintly visible in the vision above them, 9:16 aspect ratio.
