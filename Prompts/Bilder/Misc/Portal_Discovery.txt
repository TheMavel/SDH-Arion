A dramatic digital artwork of three friends standing before a glowing white portal at the top of an impossible staircase, in a luminescent cave hidden within the Grand Canyon, dark fantasy style, otherworldly blue-white light emanating from the portal contrasting with the warm amber tones of the cave walls, deep reds and ethereal blues with accents of gold where light strikes crystal formations, low-angle perspective emphasizing the monumentality of the doorway and the smallness of the humans before it, awe-inspiring and terrifying, with ancient symbols carved into the rock pulsing with light as if awakening to the presence of the three friends.
