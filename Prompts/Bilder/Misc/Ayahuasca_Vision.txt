A digital painting of three young men in a trance state, surrounded by swirling visions and spiritual symbols during an Ayahuasca ceremony, in a dimly lit ceremonial hut in Cancun, mystical surrealism style, ethereal candlelight illuminating their faces against deep shadows, rich earth tones with vibrant accents of blue and purple energy, immersive first-person perspective creating a sense of participation in the ritual, otherworldly and transcendent, with the shaman Miguel observing from the corner as geometric patterns and whispered prophecies materialize in the smoke above them.
