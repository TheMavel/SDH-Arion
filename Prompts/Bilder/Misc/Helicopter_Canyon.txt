A cinematic digital painting of three hungover friends in a helicopter flying over the Grand Canyon at sunset, with the vast red rock formations stretching below them, photorealistic adventure style, golden-hour lighting casting long shadows across the canyon while the interior of the helicopter remains in cool shadow, rich warm oranges and reds contrasting with the deep blues of approaching night, wide panoramic composition showing both the majesty of the landscape and the intimate space of the helicopter cabin, exhilarating yet ominous, with strange light patterns briefly visible deep within the canyon that only one of the friends notices with widening eyes.
