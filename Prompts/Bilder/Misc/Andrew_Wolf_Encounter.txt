A detailed digital illustration of a terrified young man confronting an enormous blonde wolf in a primeval forest, as the wolf begins transforming into a tattooed warrior, fantasy realism style, dappled sunlight filtering through ancient trees casting complex patterns of light and shadow, rich forest greens and earthy browns with the wolf's golden fur as a striking focal point, dynamic composition capturing the moment of transformation with the human backing away in shock, tense and mystical, with tribal tattoos on the half-transformed being beginning to glow with inner power while fallen leaves swirl around them in an unnatural breeze.
