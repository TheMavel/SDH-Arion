A painterly digital illustration of an injured man awakening in an alchemist's tent, confronted by a stern elder with piercing eyes showing him an ancient book, in a mysterious settlement with a mountain and energy dome visible through the tent opening, mystical science fiction style, soft diffused light filtering through the tent canvas creating an otherworldly glow, muted earth tones with accents of glowing blue from strange apparatus and symbols, intimate composition focusing on the exchange between the two figures with the outside world partially revealed, disorienting and fascinating, with arcane instruments and scrolls scattered around them while magical energy subtly connects between the book and the awakened man.
