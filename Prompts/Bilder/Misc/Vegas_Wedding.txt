A digital illustration of a joyful wedding reception in a glamorous Las Vegas venue, with Brian embracing Julie at the center while Jake delivers an emotional toast, in a lavishly decorated ballroom with neon lights filtering through elegant drapery, modern realism style, warm golden lighting with blue and purple accent lights casting long shadows, rich blacks and golds with pops of vibrant color from flowers and cocktails, wide-angle composition capturing both intimate emotion and celebratory atmosphere, festive yet tinged with foreboding, with subtle reflections in champagne glasses revealing strange patterns that mirror the friends' shared vision.
