A digital painting of Jake and Fiori during shadow manipulation training on a cliff overlooking a tropical ocean, ethereal shadows swirling between Jake's hands as he attempts to master his abilities, cinematic Star Wars poster style, dramatic lighting with golden sunset light casting long shadows across the scene, deep blues and oranges with mysterious black shadow tendrils weaving through the composition, vertically composed with Jake and Fiori in the lower portion and the vast sky and ocean stretching above, magical and intimate atmosphere, Fiori demonstrating the technique with perfect shadow control, her eyes momentarily glowing golden as she channels her power, subtle shadowy figures visible in the patterns they create, 9:16 aspect ratio.
