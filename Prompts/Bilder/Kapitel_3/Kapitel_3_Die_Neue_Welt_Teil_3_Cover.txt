A digital painting of Brian studying ancient tomes in the Varitas library with Pilus observing from the shadows, magical symbols glowing from the pages and levitating around him, in a vast underground scholarly sanctuary carved into the mountain, cinematic Star Wars poster style, dramatic lighting with warm amber lanterns illuminating the books while cool blue light emanates from the magical texts, rich browns and blues with golden accents where knowledge manifests physically, vertically composed with Brian in the foreground surrounded by floating texts and the cavernous library extending upward, scholarly and mysterious atmosphere, Brian's wedding ring glinting as he touches a particularly significant passage, subtle images of doorways and portals appearing in the magical manifestations around him, 9:16 aspect ratio.
